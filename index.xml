      <description>Short Bio I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at Georgia Tech, working with Prof. X. Andy Sun. I am interested in the theory and application of optimization in a broad sense. I am currently working on distributed and decomposition algorithms with convergence guarantees for nonconvex optimization, which find their applications in large-scale continuous and discrete problems arising from engineering, especially power systems, and data science. Before joining the Ph.</description>
